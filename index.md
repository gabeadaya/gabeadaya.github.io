## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

Lab 2:
I liked Lab 2 because it was our first real introduction into coding in C++ using very common terms such as declaring variables and initializing. We also implemented prompts and inputs that gave us a response. I learned about how the C++ standard library worked, as well as the way to properly format and prompt the files. It wasnâ€™t to difficult of an introduction to C++ and it set up future labs well.

Lab 6 Part 2:
I liked Lab 6 Part 2 because it introduced writing code for the real game Blackjack. It was really interesting learning how to implement all these different components that made up the rules of Blackjack. I think this lab was useful because it taught us how to demonstrate calling functions, which I struggled with. It also helped me learning new techniques like stoi and input validation.

Lab 9 Part 2:
Lab 9 Part 2 tasked us with creating a spell checker program, teaching us how to read from text files and compute lists of misspelled words. I liked this lab because it was definitely more challenging than previous labs, yet learning how to do these validations and calling functions were very beneficial in my comprehension of C++. It allowed me to better understand things such as a vector holding a collection of strings and other more complex subjects.
